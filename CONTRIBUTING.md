> Thank you for considering contributing to **forum**! We welcome any help, be it in the form of bug reports, feature suggestions, documentation updates, or code contributions. Please read this document to ensure that your contributions follow the project's standards.

## **Good practices**

Before submitting your contributions, please make sure to follow these good practices:

- Write clear and concise commit messages.

- Test your changes thoroughly.
- Provide documentation when necessary.
- Be respectful and constructive in your interactions with other contributors.

## **Naming conventions**

- Use lowercase for all file and folder names.
- For multi-word HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file names use kebab-case (e.g., `my-file-name`), and for Golang use snake_case (e.g., `my_file_name`).
- Use kebab-case for HTML element and attribute names (e.g., `my-element-name`).
- Use [BEM (Block Element Modifier)](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/bem_by_example) methodology to structure your CSS code. (e.g., `block__element--modifier`).
- Use camelCase for Golang and JavaScript variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for Golang and JavaScript struct, interface, class, and constructor names.
- Use UPPER_CASE for Golang and JavaScript constants.

## **Code organization**

All Golang code should be located in the `./src` directory, following the standard Go project structure. The `./public` directory contains all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
